    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        The control was established by slotted template laydowns of
        previous work. The control points are transferred from the
        aerial photographs of the previous work to the new
        Photographs of the current work.
        The points are delineated on the 1:15840 aerial photographs
        using a stereoscope and pen. The
        points from the photgraphs are transferred to the basemap
        (1:15840) with use of a sketchmaster. The
        base map is then digitized using Arc/Info and a digitizing
        table.
        The points are given an id to distinguish from other types
        of points.
