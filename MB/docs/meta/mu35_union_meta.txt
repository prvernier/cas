  Description:
    Abstract:
      All the Forest Resource Inventory polygon coverages Unioned
      (combined).
      coverages: 
      	Land; forest stands, roads, lakes, rivers, townsites, transmission lines, etc...),
        Status; Provincial Forest, Wildlife Management Area, Forest Management Liscence etc..),
        Owner; Crown, Municipal, Patented, Indian Reservation, etc...)
        Manunit; Forest Management Unit Boundaries)
    Purpose:
      Area calculation of Vegetative Forest Land by status,
      ownership and Forest Management Unit used in conjunction
      with volume calculations to determine Annual Allowable cuts.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        The control was established by slotted template laydowns of
        previous work. The control points are transferred from the
        aerial photographs of the previous work to the new
        Photographs of the current work.
        
        The polygon boundaries are delineated on the 1:15840 aerial
        photographs using a stereoscope and pen. 
        
        The lines from the photgraphs are transferred to the basemap
        (1:15840) with use of a sketchmaster. 
        
        The base map is then digitized using Arc/Info and a digitizing
        table.
        
        Each polygon is classified by a photo interpretter using a
        stereoscope and 1:15840 aerial photographs. The
        polygons are classified by forest vegetative
        characteristics which are entered into the INFO file (database). 
        
        Union is created by using the Union process (Arc/Info)
        which combines the Land, Owner, Status, Manunit, coverages
        into one.
