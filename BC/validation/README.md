Bryoid and Shrub defined as land cover classes. We currently use this to get NFL component. Only one per layer.
Species_1 and Species_2 list Spruce and Larch, but CROWN_CLOSURE is only 5 so this is technically a non-forest polygon.

The land cover and Forestry components her appear to be completely independent, but we are combining them into one schema.

The species percent values are proportional and sum to 100.
The land cover classes (that we use for NFL) are area based but don't have to sum to 100. For example
an adjacent polygon has a river at 5%.
