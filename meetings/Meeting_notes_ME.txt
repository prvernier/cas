PRODUCTIVE_FOR translation meeting

PV away Sep 16 - Oct 7

Layers - separate meeting re: forested and non forested layers, normalized vs denormalized design. 
ME and PV to list scenarios the db design needs to deal with. Includes question of whether the NFL
table should only include NFL polygons. Right now all table include all polygons.

- Ambiguity/inconsistency to be resolved between Non-productive forest attribute in PRODUCTIVE_FOR,
and actual NFL polygons as defined in the NFL tables. e.g. where does wetland get defined. May be some 
overlap between tables that we need to resolve.

Q of interpreting, 
- e.g. suppose a polygon has no species info, but it has been logged. Using the standard translation
rules this would not be recorded as a Potentially Productive polygon because it doesn't have a species recorded. 
- We might infer this polygon should be Potentially Productive based on the fact that it has been logged. To what
degree do we make these inferences. 
- PR says we don't infer beyond the existing data. What if the disturbance record was an error, then we just created
a forest stand where there isn't one.
- We should log these examples and review them later. For now we just do the basic translation with the available data.

PROCUCTIVE_FOR might be able to be inferred from existing already computed CASFRI attributes, insteaf of directly from source data.
- We would need to add functionality to the engine to do this. Right now for translations based on derived attributes we recompute 
the attribute in the helper function code.
