      In mixed  stands the species are listed in decreasing order of dominance. Species estimated to account for less than 20% of the total volume are not included. Forest cover types with a tree  understory are indicated by a horizontal line. In areas containing two or more forest types, the relative amounts of each type is given by deciles enclosed in brackets. Coverages are listed in order of predominance eg. C1, C2, C3.
